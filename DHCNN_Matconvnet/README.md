# DHCNN implementation via Matconvnet

# How to use this code

1. You should first download and install the matconvnet, which can refer to this link (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/). Here, we assume the installation location of matconvent is "DHCNN_Matconvnet/matconvnet";
2. Download the pre-trained deep models from website (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/), for examples: imagenet-vgg-s.mat or imagenet-vgg-f.mat. Put them into the folder "DHCNN_Matconvnet/models";
3. Download remote sensing image datasets. The dataset is organized in images. Here, we provide UC Merced dataset download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ovLnhF_Kttsc76jyJhS6yg , passwords: ucmd. 
4. Run the main file "Demo_DHCNN.m" to obtain the retrieval and classfication results.
